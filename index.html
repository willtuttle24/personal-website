						<h2>About Will</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After graduating the University of Northern Iowa with HR and MIS degrees, I accepted a contractor job as a Talent Acquisition Partner for the Intern Technology Program at Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa. 
						This opportunity has allowed me to experience being a part of a cross-functional team, testing new processes and technology, and gave me an idea of the skills I need to learn to further my career.
					</p>
					<p>As a student at Thinkful, I've began my journey to become a software engineer and am excited where it will take me.</p>
					<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, please reach out!</p>
